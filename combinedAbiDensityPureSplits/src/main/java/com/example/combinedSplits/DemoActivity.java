 * This is a small port of the "San Angeles Observation" demo
 * program for OpenGL ES 1.x. For more details, see:
 *
 *    http://jet.ro/visuals/san-angeles-observation/
 *
 * This program demonstrates how to use a GLSurfaceView from Java
 * along with native OpenGL calls to perform frame rendering.
 *
 * Touching the screen will start/stop the animation.
 *
 * Note that the demo runs much faster on the emulator than on
 * real devices, this is mainly due to the following facts:
 *
 * - the demo sends bazillions of polygons to OpenGL without
 *   even trying to do culling. Most of them are clearly out
 *   of view.
 *
 * - on a real device, the GPU bus is the real bottleneck
 *   that prevent the demo from getting acceptable performance.
 *
 * - the software OpenGL engine used in the emulator uses
 *   the system bus instead, and its code rocks :-)
 *
 * Fixing the program to send less polygons to the GPU is left
 * as an exercise to the reader. As always, patches welcomed :-)
